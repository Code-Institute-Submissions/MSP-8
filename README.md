# Choose your own adventure 

The purpose of Milestone Project 3 is to create a a text based choose your own adventure game, using python

# Project Summary

The Project will enable a user to:
- Partake in a mini adventure game
- Manipulate the direction of the story line via manual input
- 

## Benefits and Rational

Such an application will:
- 

## User Stories

Below is a high-level list of User Stories for the purposes of development, testing and delivery.

Business Case User stories:

- As a User I want to be able to deploy and play the command-line application easily.
- As a User I want to be able to navigate throughout the story with easy
- As a User I want all errors clearly explained and corrective actions available
- As a User I want the adventure to have a clear begining, middle, and ending


Functional Developer stories:
-	As a Developer I want to ensure the command-line application python code passes through the official validator without faults/errors/warnings
-	As a Developer I want to ensure all intended functionality works as per critial project objectives.
-	As a Developer I want to ensure that all code means the minimum standards for readability as per PEP8
-	As a Developer I want to ensure the command-line application is responsive to User interaction
-   As a Developer I want to ensure the command-line application handles incorrect User Input
-	As a Developer I want to ensure there are details (wireframes and final text sections) within the README document
-	As a Developer I want to ensure the web application meets accessibility guidelines
-	As a Developer I want to be able to easily deploy this command-line application to the cloud as per the Code Institutes requirements
- 	As a Developer I want to ensure Github is used for version control of the developing code

# Functional Requirements Scope

## Design Consistancies
The following is a list of design aspects that must be maintained throughout the command-line application. 

The command-line application must be clear and concise. It should display, at a minimun:
- Display a message for each page
- Change the next step of the story based on User input
- Show a message if incorrect input have been entered
- Lead the user throw a maze of steps to "meet the Dragon"
- Once at "the Dragon", allow the user to ask Three questions
- Generate a random response to each question asked of the dragon
- If the User attempts to ask more then three questions, "the Dragon" will get angry and return the user to the start of the game
- the ability to quit the game at any stage by pressing 'q'

# Final/Existing Feature Outcomes
The final command-line application logic will be as follows:




# Future Features to be Implemented



# Testing 

Full details and evidence of testing conducted throughout the software development life cycle of this project will be maintained in a seperate document called testing.md

## Production Shakedown Pre Submission

Once the command-line application had been deployed the Python code was passed through the official PEP8 code validator

![pythonvalidator]()

All functions have been manually selected to ensure all information has been correctly populated and displayed
